Guidelines:
Start a new branch for each contribution.
Give the branch a descriptive name.
Track the new branch with an Issue.  
Once the feature is completed, close the Issue.
Track bugs within a branch with an Issue.  
An Issue can be a group of similar bugs or a single feature.
There can be more than one Issue per branch, just do what makes sense- use the Goldilocks principle.
